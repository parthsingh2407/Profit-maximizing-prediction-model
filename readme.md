1. Open Final folder and run &quot;xgb.R&quot; script for our best prediction model which can be found in the folder &quot;Final&quot;.
2. Set the working directory to the current path where the files are extracted.
3. Similarly, other models are also included within the folder which lead to somewhat closer predictions.
